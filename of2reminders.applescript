OmniFocus2Reminders - Selection

## Overview

Send selected tasks in OmniFocus to Reminders.app

## Use Case

I like to keep my errand tasks in OmniFocus, but I also want the convenience of shared family shopping lists
via Reminders.

## Notes

You can configure the script to:

- Send OmniFocus tasks to multiple Reminders lists or a single list
- Complete OmniFocus task after sent to the Reminders app. (cleanUp:"complete")
- Keep OmniFocus task active and note it with date/time sent to Reminders (cleanUp:"link")

NB: The default cleanUp is link. Note you can use this script with OF2Reminders-Sync to complete the tasks in 
 OmniFocus once they have been completed in Reminders.

(* ################################ CONFIGURATION ################################ *)

-- if you want to keep the OmniFocus tasks active, set cleanUp to "link"
-- if yoy want to complete the OmniFocus tasks after sending them to Reminders app
-- set cleanUp to "complete"

property cleanUp : "link"

-- If you want to send OmniFocus tasks to multiple Reminders lists, set listMode to "multi"
-- If you want to sent OmniFocus tasks to a single lise, set listMode to "single"

property listMode : "multi"

-- If you have, say multiple shared shopping lists in the Reminders App whose 
-- name match an OmniFocus context name, add them the the contextList property:

property contextList : {"costco", "trader joe's", "petsmart", "target", "price chopper", "cvs", "amazon"}

-- defaultList is the name of the Reminders list you want any task without a context to go.

property defaultList : "Reminders"
